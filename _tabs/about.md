# About Me

Hi 👋, I’m **Gilbert Kamau**, a software developer with a strong interest in **backend development, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data structures & algorithms**. I enjoy building scalable systems, exploring intelligent solutions, and breaking down complex concepts into practical implementations.

## What I Do

- **Backend Development**  
  I design and build robust backend systems using modern frameworks and APIs, focusing on performance, security, and maintainability.

- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**  
  I explore applied AI concepts such as NLP, machine learning models, and real-world data-driven solutions, documenting experiments and insights through projects and blogs.

- **Cloud Computing**  
  I work with cloud platforms to deploy, manage, and scale applications, covering topics like cloud architecture, deployment strategies, and infrastructure fundamentals.

- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**  
  I regularly practice and write about DSA concepts, problem-solving techniques, and algorithmic thinking.

## What You’ll Find Here

- 📌 Projects showcasing backend systems, AI applications, and cloud-deployed solutions  
- ✍️ Technical blogs explaining concepts, lessons learned, and best practices  
- 🧠 DSA write-ups focused on logic, efficiency, and clean problem-solving  

## My Goal

To continuously learn, build, and share knowledge while creating impactful software solutions that solve real-world problems.
